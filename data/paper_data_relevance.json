    "abstract": "Estimation of the Fisher Information Metric (FIM-estimation) is an important\ntask that arises in unsupervised learning of phase transitions, a problem\nproposed by physicists. This work completes the definition of the task by\ndefining rigorous evaluation metrics distMSE, distMSEPS, and distRE and\nintroduces ClassiFIM, a novel machine learning method designed to solve the\nFIM-estimation task. Unlike existing methods for unsupervised learning of phase\ntransitions, ClassiFIM directly estimates a well-defined quantity (the FIM),\nallowing it to be rigorously compared to any present and future other methods\nthat estimate the same. ClassiFIM transforms a dataset for the FIM-estimation\ntask into a dataset for an auxiliary binary classification task and involves\nselecting and training a model for the latter. We prove that the output of\nClassiFIM approaches the exact FIM in the limit of infinite dataset size and\nunder certain regularity conditions. We implement ClassiFIM on multiple\ndatasets, including datasets describing classical and quantum phase\ntransitions, and find that it achieves a good ground truth approximation with\nmodest computational resources. Furthermore, we independently implement two\nalternative state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised estimation of phase\ntransition locations on the same datasets and find that ClassiFIM predicts such\nlocations at least as well as these other methods. To emphasize the generality\nof our method, we also propose and generate the MNIST-CNN dataset, which\nconsists of the output of CNNs trained on MNIST for different hyperparameter\nchoices. Using ClassiFIM on this dataset suggests there is a phase transition\nin the distribution of image-prediction pairs for CNNs trained on MNIST,\ndemonstrating the broad scope of FIM-estimation beyond physics.",
